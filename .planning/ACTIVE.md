# Active Investigation

Last updated: 2026-02-12
Status: active

## Objective

Close the remaining strict encoder quality gap (`Q >= 0`) without parity regressions or hot-path allocation regressions.

## Current Hypothesis

The highest ROI is targeted SILK/Hybrid quality tuning first, validated against pinned libopus fixtures, before broad CELT retuning.

## Next 3 Actions (Targeted)

1. Pick one failing/weak quality profile and lock a single reproducible fixture case.
2. Run only the narrowest parity/compliance tests needed for that profile before code edits.
3. Capture a short evidence note in this file with command, result, and next decision.

## Explicit Skips For This Session

- Skip re-debugging SILK decoder correctness unless decoder-path files are touched.
- Skip re-debugging resampler parity unless resampler-path files are touched.
- Skip re-investigating NSQ constant-DC amplitude behavior unless evidence conflicts with known expected dithering behavior.

## Stop Conditions

- Stop and reassess after 3 failed hypotheses without measurable quality uplift.
- Escalate to broad gate (`make verify-production`) only when a focused change is ready for merge-level validation.

## Evidence Log (Newest First)

- 2026-02-12: Optimized CI Linux gate topology to reduce wall-clock without dropping checks. Updated `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to split prior `test-linux-verify` into parallel `test-linux-parity` (full `GOPUS_TEST_TIER=parity go test ./...`) and `test-linux-race` (`make test-race`), kept `test-linux-provenance`, and updated `test-linux` aggregator to require all three. Baseline timing evidence from recent successful runs (`gh run view 21964360695`, `gh run view 21964143086`, `gh run view 21963310494`) showed serialized `test-linux-verify` as critical path (~5m51s to ~6m28s). Local validation: YAML parse PASS (`ruby -e "require 'yaml'; YAML.load_file('.github/workflows/ci.yml')"`), compile/no-test sweep PASS (`go test ./... -run '^$' -count=1`), full gate PASS (`make verify-production`), and standalone perf gate PASS (`make bench-guard`). Next decision: observe next CI runs and confirm linux critical path drops while preserving parity/race/provenance coverage.
- 2026-02-12: Cross-platform follow-up after PR #31 CI: `test-windows` failed `TestEncoderCompliancePrecisionGuard` on three recently ratcheted floors (`SILK-WB-10ms-mono-32k`, `SILK-WB-60ms-mono-32k`, `Hybrid-SWB-10ms-mono-48k`). Applied calibrated floors that remain tighter than the previous baseline: `-0.05`, `-0.25`, and `-0.15` respectively. Validation: `go test ./testvectors -run 'TestEncoderCompliancePrecisionGuard|TestEncoderComplianceSummary|TestEncoderVariantProfileParityAgainstLibopusFixture' -count=1 -v` PASS, `make verify-production` PASS, `make bench-guard` PASS. Next decision: keep broad ratchet with these Windows-calibrated exceptions; tighten further only with new multi-OS headroom evidence.
- 2026-02-12: Tightened encoder precision floors broadly in `testvectors/encoder_precision_guard_test.go` after the CELT short-frame uplifts by ratcheting 14/19 summary profiles (CELT and most SILK/Hybrid entries), while preserving known Windows-sensitive floors unchanged (`SILK-WB-40ms-mono-32k=-0.35`, `Hybrid-FB-20ms-mono-64k=-0.55`, `Hybrid-FB-60ms-mono-64k=-0.55`, `Hybrid-FB-20ms-stereo-96k=-0.25`). Validation: `go test ./testvectors -run 'TestEncoderCompliancePrecisionGuard|TestEncoderComplianceSummary|TestEncoderVariantProfileParityAgainstLibopusFixture' -count=1 -v` PASS, `make verify-production` PASS, `make bench-guard` PASS. Next decision: keep the broader ratchet and only tighten the four held floors with new multi-OS CI headroom evidence.
- 2026-02-12: Implemented second CELT 2.5ms uplift pass by raising non-hybrid `frameSize==120` boost from `+128` to `+192` bits in `celt/encode_frame.go` (`computeTargetBits`). Quality evidence: `go test ./testvectors -run 'TestEncoderComplianceCELT/FB-2.5ms-mono' -count=1 -v` improved from `Q=-30.98` (~33.13 dB, avg target 372 bits) to `Q=-25.58` (~35.72 dB, avg target 436 bits). Guard evidence: `go test ./testvectors -run 'TestEncoderComplianceSummary|TestEncoderCompliancePrecisionGuard|TestEncoderVariantProfileParityAgainstLibopusFixture' -count=1 -v` PASS, `go test ./encoder -run TestCELTLongFrameVBRBitrateBudget -count=1 -v` PASS, `make verify-production` PASS, `make bench-guard` PASS. Next decision: keep `+192` as current best validated 2.5ms setting and continue strict-quality closure on remaining short-frame/stereo cases.
- 2026-02-12: Completed docs/readme sync pass across root markdown and examples docs, including new assembly coverage documentation (`ASSEMBLY.md`) and README linkage. Resolved stale docs drift (`examples/README.md` Go version floor, removed reference to nonexistent `.planning/STATE.md`, synced `CODEX.md`/`CLAUDE.md` first-reply checklist with AGENTS). Validation: `go test ./... -run '^$' -count=1` PASS, `make verify-production` PASS, `make bench-guard` PASS. Next decision: treat `ASSEMBLY.md` as the single assembly coverage inventory and update it whenever `.s` surfaces or build tags change.
- 2026-02-12: Tightened validation floors across the summary matrix in `testvectors/encoder_precision_guard_test.go` with a broad +0.30 dB ratchet, then applied targeted cross-platform headroom adjustments for four Windows-sensitive speech profiles (`SILK-WB-40ms-mono-32k`, `Hybrid-FB-20ms-mono-64k`, `Hybrid-FB-60ms-mono-64k`, `Hybrid-FB-20ms-stereo-96k`) after CI evidence. Validation: local `TestEncoderCompliancePrecisionGuard`, `TestEncoderComplianceSummary`, `TestEncoderVariantProfileParityAgainstLibopusFixture`, `make verify-production`, and `make bench-guard` PASS; Windows failure root cause captured from PR #30 CI logs and resolved in-threshold update.
- 2026-02-12: Implemented next short-frame quality uplift: non-hybrid CELT `frameSize==240` receives `+64` target bits in `celt/encode_frame.go` (`computeTargetBits`). Quality evidence: `go test ./testvectors -run TestEncoderComplianceCELT -count=1 -v` PASS with `FB-5ms-mono` improving from `Q=-18.10` (~39.31 dB) to `Q=-14.05` (~41.25 dB), target stats avg `473 -> 548` bits. Guard evidence: `go test ./testvectors -run 'TestEncoderComplianceSummary|TestEncoderCompliancePrecisionGuard|TestEncoderVariantProfileParityAgainstLibopusFixture' -count=1 -v` PASS, `go test ./encoder -run TestCELTLongFrameVBRBitrateBudget -count=1 -v` PASS, `make verify-production` PASS, `make bench-guard` PASS. Next decision: keep `+64` at 5ms and continue short-frame/stereo quality closure while preserving libopus parity.
- 2026-02-12: Addressed CELT short-frame under-allocation by adding a non-hybrid `frameSize==120` boost of `+128` bits in `celt/encode_frame.go` (`computeTargetBits`). Quality evidence: `go test ./testvectors -run TestEncoderComplianceCELT -count=1 -v` PASS with `FB-2.5ms-mono` improved from `Q=-43.27` (~27.23 dB) to `Q=-30.98` (~33.13 dB), and target stats increased from avg `226` to `372` bits. Guard evidence: `go test ./celt -run TestCeltTargetBits25ms -count=1 -v` PASS, `go test ./encoder -run TestCELTLongFrameVBRBitrateBudget -count=1 -v` PASS, `go test ./testvectors -run 'TestEncoderComplianceSummary|TestEncoderCompliancePrecisionGuard|TestEncoderVariantProfileParityAgainstLibopusFixture' -count=1 -v` PASS, `make verify-production` PASS, `make bench-guard` PASS. Next decision: keep the `+128` 2.5ms boost as current best validated short-frame setting and continue strict-quality closure on SILK/Hybrid.
- 2026-02-12: Investigated PR #28 CI failures on linux/windows (`TestOpusdecCrossvalFixtureCoverage` missing SHA entries). Root cause: `make fixtures-gen-amd64` regenerated libopus amd64 fixtures but not `celt/testdata/opusdec_crossval_fixture_amd64.json`, while `celt` tests select `_amd64` fixtures on `runtime.GOARCH=="amd64"`. Fix: added `GOPUS_OPUSDEC_CROSSVAL_FIXTURE_OUT` support to `tools/gen_opusdec_crossval_fixture.go`, wired generator into `fixtures-gen-amd64`, then regenerated amd64 fixture with `make fixtures-gen-amd64`. Validation: linux/amd64 container run of `go test ./celt -run 'TestOpusdecCrossvalFixtureCoverage|TestOpusdecCrossvalFixtureHonestyAgainstLiveOpusdec' -count=1 -v` PASS; broad gate `make verify-production` PASS. Next decision: keep arch-specific crossval fixture regeneration coupled to amd64 fixture workflow.
- 2026-02-12: Finalized CELT 20ms non-hybrid boost ceiling at `+1216` bits for high-budget frames (`baseBits >= 1024`) and kept reduced-budget subframes at `+256` in `celt/encode_frame.go`. Quality evidence: `go test ./testvectors -run TestEncoderComplianceSummary -count=1 -v` PASS with `CELT-FB-20ms-mono-64k Q=-8.27` and `CELT-FB-20ms-stereo-128k Q=-9.01` (up from prior baseline `Q=-9.91` / `Q=-11.99`; approx +1.64 dB and +2.98 dB SNR). Guardrails: `TestEncoderCompliancePrecisionGuard`, `TestEncoderVariantProfileParityAgainstLibopusFixture`, `TestCELTLongFrameVBRBitrateBudget` all PASS. Broad gate: `make verify-production` PASS (parity, bench-guard, race). Next decision: keep `+1216` ceiling as current best validated setting.
- 2026-02-12: Ran high-budget CELT boost sweep (`+512,+640,+768,+896,+1024,+1152,+1216,+1280`) against libopus-anchored guards. Result: quality continued improving up to `+1280` but `go run ./tools/gen_opusdec_crossval_fixture.go` failed on `stereo_20ms_silence` with libopus `opusdec` open/decode failure; `+1216` is highest tested value that preserves fixture generation and live-opusdec honesty checks. Next decision: do not exceed `+1216` without first fixing silence-packet interoperability.
- 2026-02-12: Regenerated CELT opusdec crossval fixture after intentional CELT packet-budget change: `go run ./tools/gen_opusdec_crossval_fixture.go` (wrote `celt/testdata/opusdec_crossval_fixture.json`). Verified fixture parity with live decoder: `go test ./celt -run 'TestOpusdecCrossvalFixtureCoverage|TestOpusdecCrossvalFixtureHonestyAgainstLiveOpusdec' -count=1 -v` PASS. Broad gate now clean: `make verify-production` PASS (includes parity tests, bench-guard, and race). Next decision: keep fixture update with codec change to maintain deterministic crossval coverage.
- 2026-02-12: Implemented targeted CELT budget uplift in `celt/encode_frame.go` (`computeTargetBits`: keep +128 for 10ms and add +256 for 20ms when non-hybrid). Validation: `go test ./testvectors -run TestEncoderComplianceSummary -count=1 -v` (PASS) with measurable CELT gains (`CELT-FB-20ms-mono-64k: Q -9.91 -> -9.34`, `CELT-FB-20ms-stereo-128k: Q -11.99 -> -10.84`; +0.28 to +0.55 dB SNR). Guardrails still green: `go test ./testvectors -run TestEncoderCompliancePrecisionGuard -count=1 -v` PASS, `go test ./encoder -run 'TestHybridVBRBitrateBudget|TestCELTLongFrameVBRBitrateBudget' -count=1 -v` PASS, `go test ./testvectors -run TestEncoderVariantProfileParityAgainstLibopusFixture -count=1 -v` PASS. Next decision: keep this CELT uplift and re-run merge-level gates before handoff.
- 2026-02-12: Tested long-frame SWB ModeAuto hint retuning against `TestEncoderVariantProfileParityAgainstLibopusFixture` focused cases (`HYBRID-SWB-40ms-*`, `HYBRID-FB-60ms-*`). Result: unstable mode switching caused worse ratchet metrics in SWB speech/am_multisine; hypothesis rejected and encoder-mode heuristic edits were reverted. Next decision: avoid SWB ModeAuto heuristic churn in this session and prioritize deterministic CELT quality uplift.
- 2026-02-12: Ran narrow speech-mode slices for rapid repro: `go test ./testvectors -run 'TestEncoderComplianceSILK/WB-20ms-mono' -count=1 -v` and `go test ./testvectors -run 'TestEncoderComplianceHybrid/SWB-20ms-mono' -count=1 -v` (both PASS; absolute quality baseline remains ~`Q=-50.7`, near 23.6-23.7 dB SNR). Next decision: inspect encoder-side SILK analysis/gain/noise-shaping parity path for targeted uplift opportunities.
- 2026-02-12: Ran `go test ./testvectors -run TestEncoderComplianceSummary -count=1 -v` (PASS, `19 passed, 0 failed`); parity-gap status remains GOOD/BASE across fixtures, but strict absolute target (`Q >= 0`) still unmet (worst current CELT absolute Q observed: `CELT-FB-20ms-stereo-128k` at `Q=-11.99`). Next decision: use a narrower CELT slice for fast iterations, then implement targeted encoder-side quality tuning.
- 2026-02-12: Initialized active-memory workflow for agent sessions; no codec math changes in this update.
