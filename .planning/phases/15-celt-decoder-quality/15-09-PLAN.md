<objective>
Fix the root cause of Q=-100 based on diagnostic evidence from plans 15-06, 15-07, 15-08

Purpose: Plans 15-06/07/08 provide diagnostic infrastructure (tracing, PVQ tests, allocation tests, bit consumption tracking). This plan uses that diagnostic data to identify and fix the actual bug causing complete output mismatch.

Output: Fixed CELT decoder with improved quality on at least one test vector

  <decision>Identify root cause from diagnostic evidence</decision>
  <context>
Plans 15-06/07/08 should have produced diagnostic output showing:
- Trace of CELT decoding stages with intermediate values
- PVQ/CWRS test results (pass/fail)
- Bit allocation test results (pass/fail)
- Bit consumption tracking (expected vs actual)

Common CELT decoder bugs and their signatures:
1. **CWRS indexing bug**: PVQ tests fail, pulse vectors incorrect
2. **Bit allocation mismatch**: Bit consumption doesn't match allocation, later bands get garbage
3. **Energy prediction bug**: Energy values are reasonable but wrong (already fixed in 15-01/02?)
4. **Range decoder desync**: Total bits consumed != packet bits, values diverge mid-packet
5. **Coefficient assembly bug**: Individual bands decode correctly, but assembly is wrong
6. **Stereo processing bug**: Mono works, stereo doesn't (or vice versa)
7. **Frame size scaling bug**: Some frame sizes work, others don't

  <resume-signal>
Review diagnostic output from 15-06/07/08 and identify which option applies.
Report which tests failed, what the trace showed, and select the appropriate fix path.
If diagnostics are inconclusive, select "multiple-fix" and investigate further.

  <name>Task 2: Apply targeted fix based on root cause</name>
  <files>internal/celt/decoder.go, internal/celt/bands.go, internal/celt/energy.go, internal/celt/alloc.go, internal/celt/cwrs.go</files>
  <action>
Based on the root cause identified in Task 1, apply the targeted fix.

**If CWRS indexing bug:**
- Review DecodePulses algorithm
- Compare with libopus celt/cwrs.c cwrs64_decode_pulses()
- Fix index interpretation, sign bit extraction, or recurrence formula

**If bit allocation bug:**
- Compare ComputeAllocation with libopus celt/rate.c
- Fix budget calculation, scaling, or distribution
- Ensure sum(BandBits) + sum(FineBits) == expected

**If energy decoding bug:**
- Check coarse energy prediction formula
- Check fine energy uniform decode
- Check energy remainder handling

**If coefficient assembly bug:**
- Check band coefficient ordering
- Check scaling by energy
- Check transient mode interleaving

**If range decoder desync:**
- Add bit position assertions after each stage
- Find where actual diverges from expected
- Fix the stage that consumes wrong bits

Document the fix with clear comments explaining:
- What was wrong
- How it was identified
- How it was fixed
- Reference to libopus equivalent code

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Verify quality improvement on test vectors</name>
  <files>internal/testvectors/compliance_test.go</files>
  <action>
Run CELT test vectors and verify quality improvement.

1. Run TestDecoderCompliance focused on CELT vectors:
   ```
   go test -v ./internal/testvectors/... -run "TestDecoderCompliance/testvector01" -count=1
   go test -v ./internal/testvectors/... -run "TestDecoderCompliance/testvector07" -count=1
   go test -v ./internal/testvectors/... -run "TestDecoderCompliance/testvector11" -count=1
   ```

2. Record Q values before and after fix:
   - Before: Q=-100 (from verification)
   - After: Q=??? (should be better)

3. If Q is still very negative but improved:
   - Identify remaining issues
   - May need additional fixes in subsequent plan

4. If Q >= 0 on any vector:
   - Document as success
   - Phase goal partially achieved

5. Update any tests that now need adjustment due to the fix.
  </action>
  <verify>At least one CELT test vector shows Q > -100 (improved quality)</verify>
  <done>Quality measured on CELT test vectors, improvement documented</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
- All CELT tests pass
- At least one CELT test vector shows quality improvement (Q > -100)
- Fix is documented with comments explaining the issue
- No regressions in other tests
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Root cause identified from diagnostic evidence
- Targeted fix applied and tested
- Quality improvement verified on at least one CELT test vector
- If Q >= 0 achieved on any vector, DEQ-02 progress made
</success_criteria>
