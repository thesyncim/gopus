# Go kernel replacement evidence

This report tracks all 53 symbols from the 41 assembly files in the pre-port
`origin/master` tree. Every entry has a Go replacement. `archsimd` means the
Go 1.27 `simd/archsimd` implementation selected by `GOEXPERIMENT=simd`; ordinary
builds use the listed scalar Go path, and `-tags nosimd` forces the scalar
reference path.

## Correctness status

Parity is measured against live libopus 1.6.1 builds of the same instruction
set on the same machine. On amd64, Go SIMD (`GOEXPERIMENT=simd`) pairs with the
SSE/AVX2 RTCD tree (`tmp_check/opus-1.6.1-simd`, gcc -O3), and ordinary Go and
`nosimd` pair with the scalar tree (`tmp_check/opus-1.6.1-scalar`, -O3
-fno-tree-vectorize -fno-tree-slp-vectorize). On arm64 the same three Go modes
pair with Apple clang 21.0.0 builds of the NEON and scalar trees. Build stamps, runtime
dispatch and PCM identity are checked by the strict paired gates, which fail
on every packet-byte or final-range difference. Some legacy stateful tests
only log differences on ARM64 and `nosimd`; their PASS alone does not
establish exact parity.

Strict matched CBR oracle, 19 configurations and 2,175 packets:

| Lane | C reference | Exact configurations |
|---|---|---:|
| amd64 Go SIMD | SSE/AVX2 RTCD, gcc | 19 / 19 |
| amd64 ordinary Go | scalar, gcc | 19 / 19 |
| amd64 `nosimd` | scalar, gcc | 19 / 19 |
| arm64 Go SIMD | NEON, Apple clang 21 | 19 / 19 |
| arm64 ordinary Go | scalar, Apple clang 21 | 19 / 19 |
| arm64 `nosimd` | scalar, Apple clang 21 | 19 / 19 |

The ARM64 entries use Go 1.27.0 with the Hybrid transient gate and explicit
gain-fade contraction, and report zero packet and final-range differences in
each lane. The AMD64 entries are the native `b0c9c56a` CI results; native
validation of these Hybrid changes is pending.

The strict Hybrid low-complexity regression compares all eight frames of
mono 10 ms and stereo 20 ms SWB 48 kbps VBR at complexities 0 and 1. Every
packet and final range matches in ordinary, SIMD, and `nosimd` ARM64 builds.
Both warmed caller-buffer complexity-0 allocation checks report zero. The
independent gain-fade oracle calls libopus's actual static `gain_fade` and
compares every output float bit across 13 in-place mono/stereo cases at
48/24 kHz; all three local modes pass.

The per-frame encode differential sweep (`TestEncodeDifferentialFuzz`) matches
libopus on every frame on amd64 in the Go SIMD, ordinary and `nosimd` lanes: no
CELT, hybrid or SILK payload, TOC or final-range differences.

Open differences, each with a live-oracle reproducer:
- Encoder: Hybrid tight-budget and mode-transition redundancy handling, and
  CELT/Hybrid multi-frame packet handling remain under investigation. The
  matched ARM64 forced-Hybrid stateful sweep records 20 differing frames in
  10 of 288 configurations in each of the three build modes (eight complexity-0
  cases and two complexity-5 cases); its legacy PASS does not waive these
  differences. The multistream and projection encoders differ in rate
  allocation, surround masking and analysis input.
- Decoder: silent frames do not run the full deemphasis (VERY_SMALL), one
  SIMD-lane CELT stereo sample differs by 1 ULP, SILK stereo LBRR concealment
  uses a separate PLC path, and the multistream decoder keeps its own copy of
  the frame decoder.
- amd64 SIMD pitch cross-correlation kernels differ from gcc's instruction order
  on NaN payloads and signed zeros, and the scalar float32 FMA emulation
  (`float32(math.FMA(...))`) double-rounds in rare cases.
- arm64: the NEON build's auto-vectorized reductions (PLC LPC/autocorrelation,
  pitch search and others) and clang's contraction in the SILK float kernels
  are not yet mirrored everywhere.

The live tonality-analysis tests compare every AnalysisInfo field and analyzer
state after each frame, across sample rates, channels, and frame durations.
Both `TestAnalysisMatchesLibopusLive` and its encoder-variant sweep pass on
native AMD64 SIMD at `b0c9c56a`. Local ARM64 ordinary and `nosimd` package
sweeps pass with Apple clang 21.0.0, but the SIMD sweep has exact tonality,
noisiness, slope, and RNN-state differences. The `b0c9c56a` production files
yield identical analysis and stereo PLC diagnostics in a baseline overlay.
These differences require separate diagnosis; the CBR pass does not establish
complete analysis parity.

## Measurement method

M4 Max (`darwin/arm64`) A/B measurements use the same host and Go version for
each old-assembly/candidate pair. Initial rows use Go 1.27.1; ARM64 tone LPC
and tuned IMDCT pre-rotate, fold, middle-fold, post-twiddle, and comb filter use
Go 1.27.0. The direct benchmark set uses GOMAXPROCS=4 and five samples per
mode; the initial rows use 100 ms samples and the added inventory wrappers use
200 ms samples.
The tuned PCM and ARM64 SILK xcorr rows use five 250 ms samples; ARM64 tone
LPC uses five interleaved 300 ms samples. All use GOMAXPROCS=4 on the same M4.
The tuned SILK float conversion row uses 20 interleaved samples per mode with
one million calls per sample and the same N=480 input fixture. Pitch detection
uses scale 1; scale 32768 is measured separately.
The tuned SILK 21846 FIR row uses 20 interleaved samples per mode with 400,000
calls per sample and the live nOut=240, bufLen=87 fixture.
The tuned SILK 32768 and 43691 FIR rows use five 300 ms samples per mode on
the same M4 with nOut=240; production-dispatch timings include the wrapper.
The tuned SILK int16-to-float32 row uses five 300 ms samples per mode on the
same M4 with N=480 and compares the production-dispatch path.
The tuned ARM64 SILK pitch-xcorr row uses five paired 300 ms samples per mode
on the same M4 with length=240 and maxPitch=120.
The tuned ARM64 SILK LPC synthesis row uses five paired 300 ms samples per mode
on the same M4 with subframe length 80. One assembly sample is a low outlier;
the other four measure 249.2–250.5 ns/op.
The tuned ARM64 unit PCM conversion row uses five interleaved outer runs with
500,000 calls per mode and n=480; the table gives the mean and range of the
five run means on the same M4 with Go 1.27.0.
The tuned ARM64 MDCT middle-fold row uses five paired 200 ms samples per mode
on the same M4 with n4=64 and blocks=8; the old assembly and both Go SIMD
versions use the same direct fixture and Go 1.27.0.
The tuned ARM64 FFT butterfly rows use three paired 200 ms samples per mode
on the same M4 with Go 1.27.0 and `-cpu=1`. The M1 fixture uses N=128; inner
radix-3/4/5 fixtures use m=8, N=4, and fstride=8 with preallocated work copies.
Candidate timings call the production dispatch wrappers.
The refined ARM64 radix-4 M1 path uses seven paired 500 ms samples on the same
M4 and fixture. Its prior and refined Go SIMD medians are 178.0 and 120.9
ns/op; both report zero allocations. The old-assembly timing is from the
earlier paired comparison, so the 103–105 ns range is a reference, not a
same-run ratio for this refinement.
The ARM64 Haar two-group unroll uses five paired 500 ms samples on M4 with
Go 1.27.0 and zero allocations. The live `haar1` wrapper with n0=32 dispatches
to the stride-4 helper with 16 groups; its current and refined Go SIMD medians
are 11.25 and 8.00 ns/op. A direct helper fixture with 32 groups measures
11.69 and 11.14 ns/op medians. These paired Go-only measurements do not use
the earlier old-assembly fixture.
The ARM64 SILK LPC synthesis refinement uses five paired same-fixture runs
with Go 1.27.0, `GOEXPERIMENT=simd`, GOMAXPROCS=1, and subframe length 80.
The current Go SIMD path measures 290.4–292.1 ns/op and the refined path
253.4–255.1 ns/op, both allocation-free. The old-assembly ~250 ns timing
comes from the earlier paired comparison and is a reference here.
The CELT PVQ two-position unroll uses ten paired samples of a normalized
N=48, K=16 low-pulse input with zeroed work buffers, matching the production
path's input shape. The scalar loop measures 705.0 ns/op median
(702.5–728.0), and the unroll measures 522.9 (518.5–527.3), both zero alloc.
The original old-assembly comparison uses a different fixture; no ratio is
inferred across those runs.
The ARM64 SILK float inner-product bounds refinement uses the same M4 and
Go 1.27.0 fixture for five paired samples: 135.6 ns/op median for the prior
Go loop and 107.1 for the refined loop, both zero alloc. Its old-assembly
comparison uses a different fixture.
The ARM64 pointer-endpoint fixes preserve kernel arithmetic and pass the full
CELT SIMD suite with `-gcflags=all=-d=checkptr=2`. Post-fix spot benchmarks
use Go 1.27.0, `GOEXPERIMENT=simd`, `-cpu=1`, three 200 ms samples on M4.
These spot timings are separate from the paired assembly comparisons in the
matrix: L1 N=480 33.54–33.65; prefilter dual N=240 26.96–27.04; scale
N=480 17.30–17.51; stereo merge N=480 50.18–50.64; tone LPC N=480
76.46–76.62; four-output xcorr N=480 133.5–133.7 ns/op.
The ARM64 CWRS row uses five paired 500 ms samples per mode on the same M4
with Go 1.27.0 and GOMAXPROCS=4. N=48, K=5 is table-covered by
`canUseCWRSFast` and reaches the fast decoder path; N=48, K=12 does not.
The ARM64 stereo deemphasis live fused helper uses five 500 ms samples per
version on the same M4 with Go 1.27.0, `GOEXPERIMENT=simd`, GOMAXPROCS=4,
and N=480. The two Go versions use the same preallocated stereo fixture;
the direct former-symbol comparison remains the scalar-core timing below.
The tuned MDCT post-twiddle row uses three interleaved 15-sample runs; its
reported ranges are the three within-run medians because individual samples
include M4 scheduling outliers. Assembly and both SIMD versions use the same
fixture.
Native AMD64 measurements use real AVX2/FMA hardware. Rosetta is useful for
cross-compilation and scalar checks but does not establish native SIMD behavior.
Kernel benchmark names retain their fixture identities across the baseline and
candidate. The corrected `b.Loop` wrappers observe outputs and vary inputs where
required; zero-valued butterfly buffers keep repeated arithmetic finite.

Run [36056914422](https://github.com/thesyncim/gopus/actions/runs/36056914422)
at `54300227` uses Intel Xeon 6973P-C, Go 1.27.1, GCC 13.3.0, and
`GOAMD64=v1`. The AMD64 inventory uses the five direct samples per mode from run
[36221836441](https://github.com/thesyncim/gopus/actions/runs/36221836441)
at `b0c9c56a` on AMD EPYC 7763, with the same toolchain and `GOAMD64=v1`.
All direct samples report zero allocations. Both runs use sequential phases;
host load or frequency changes remain a measurement risk. Ratios compare only
modes within one run.

## End-to-end codec throughput

The six public encode/decode benchmarks run on one Apple M4 Max with Go
1.27.0, `-cpu=1`, three interleaved 300 ms samples per mode, and preallocated
caller buffers. Old is the pre-port `ef5a9fe74` default assembly build;
Go SIMD and `nosimd` use `1b18fbf0` with `GOEXPERIMENT=simd`. The table gives
median ns/op; lower is faster. Every sample reports 0 B/op and 0 allocs/op.

| Fixture | Old assembly | Go SIMD | `nosimd` |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| CELT decode | 6,972 | 6,999 | 10,344 |
| Hybrid decode | 12,694 | 12,278 | 13,623 |
| SILK decode | 10,369 | 9,207 | 10,378 |
| Caller-buffer encode | 38,918 | 34,517 | 52,475 |
| VoIP encode | 46,067 | 38,627 | 61,210 |
| Low-delay encode | 40,303 | 34,744 | 54,005 |

These samples have substantial timing spread (for example, old caller-buffer
encode spans 35,914–43,802 ns/op and Go SIMD spans 33,682–40,909 ns/op).
They establish current allocation counts and measured ranges; small throughput
changes are inconclusive. The earlier quieter `cd62a758` run measures a 2.8%
SIMD improvement by equal-fixture geometric mean. The native AMD64 A/B
workflow records the same three-mode end-to-end benchmarks on one x86 runner.
These tables compare Go implementations with old Go assembly, independently
of the matched libopus scalar/SIMD correctness comparisons.

### Native AMD64 candidate

Run 36031595048 uses one AMD EPYC 9V74 runner, Go 1.27.1, `-cpu=1`, and
three 300 ms samples per mode. All samples report zero bytes and allocations.
The candidate is `cd62a758`; its unresolved correctness failures are listed
above. These measurements do not establish packet correctness.

| Fixture | Old assembly | Go SIMD candidate | `nosimd` |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| CELT decode | 20,203 | 20,227 | 22,560 |
| Hybrid decode | 29,753 | 29,829 | 31,696 |
| SILK decode | 23,528 | 23,630 | 23,987 |
| Caller-buffer encode | 92,583 | 123,113 | 118,525 |
| VoIP encode | 98,724 | 129,079 | 124,775 |
| Low-delay encode | 91,661 | 122,326 | 118,035 |

Go SIMD decode is within 0.5% of assembly on these fixtures; encode takes
30.7–33.5% more time. Ratios compare only modes on this same runner.

### Native AMD64: Intel Xeon 6973P-C

Run [36056914422](https://github.com/thesyncim/gopus/actions/runs/36056914422)
at `54300227` uses the same benchmark settings as the EPYC table above.
Every sample reports zero bytes and allocations.

| Fixture | Old assembly | Go SIMD candidate | `nosimd` |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| CELT decode | 17,207 | 14,095 | 15,591 |
| Hybrid decode | 21,354 | 18,969 | 20,069 |
| SILK decode | 15,332 | 14,729 | 14,929 |
| Caller-buffer encode | 69,964 | 65,658 | 82,568 |
| VoIP encode | 73,721 | 69,483 | 87,243 |
| Low-delay encode | 69,369 | 65,033 | 82,216 |

Go SIMD encode takes 5.7–6.3% less time and decode 3.9–18.1% less time
within this run. CPU and revision differ from the EPYC run; compare modes
within each run rather than inferring changes across these hosts.

### Native AMD64: AMD EPYC 7763

Run [36221836441](https://github.com/thesyncim/gopus/actions/runs/36221836441)
at `b0c9c56a`, Go 1.27.1, three 300 ms samples per mode, `-cpu=1`.
The assembly baseline is `8ac93c85`. All samples report zero allocations;
timings use sequential phases and the table reports median ns/op.

| Fixture | Old assembly | Go SIMD | `nosimd` |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| CELT decode | 20,260 | 17,048 | 22,812 |
| Hybrid decode | 28,414 | 24,997 | 30,427 |
| SILK decode | 22,578 | 21,770 | 23,086 |
| Caller-buffer encode | 91,925 | 88,278 | 118,414 |
| VoIP encode | 98,353 | 95,018 | 125,061 |
| Low-delay encode | 91,110 | 87,224 | 117,290 |

Within this run, Go SIMD takes 3.4–4.3% less time for encode and 3.6–15.9%
less for decode. Other host/revision tables are separate measurements;
no cross-run ratio establishes an improvement. Remaining packet and PCM
mismatches are listed under correctness status.

### Interleaved AMD64 encode and profiles

The same run compares the two builds with four interleaved 500 ms samples,
`-cpu=1`, matching PGO settings and preallocated caller buffers.

| Caller-buffer encode | Median ns/op | Sample range | Allocs/op |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Old assembly | 92,365.5 | 91,896–92,814 | 0 |
| Go SIMD | 88,174.5 | 87,928–88,376 | 0 |

Go SIMD takes 4.5% less time in this pair. It has no `nosimd` measurement.
Separate 3-second profiles put pitch search at 10.67% cumulative samples in
Go SIMD versus 5.51% in assembly; the one-pass xcorr helper has 4.67% flat
samples versus 2.20% for assembly xcorr. The SSE-order dual prefilter takes
4.67% cumulative samples in Go SIMD versus 8.59% in assembly. These shares
identify live paths; they do not establish each kernel's contribution to the
end-to-end timing difference.

## Per-symbol inventory

Former symbols identify the pre-port assembly entry points. `0` in the
allocation column is limited to directly measured kernels.

Direct timing covers all 51 comparable routines. The two startup
feature-discovery helpers have no
comparable per-call Go operation and are marked n/a with the reason.

at `b0c9c56a` passes all 19 strict CBR cases in ordinary, SIMD and `nosimd`:
zero packet differences and zero final-range differences out of 2,175 per
mode. The per-frame encode differential sweep passes. The dedicated Hybrid
SWB stereo decode reproducer also passes. The full suite retains a different
PCM mismatch and the stateful, multistream, projection and exceptional-float
cases listed in correctness status; complete parity is not established.

The native A/B job remains red. Its legacy coverage comparison reports 105
old sub-48 kHz test names absent because the names carry corrected 2.5/5 ms
durations. The scalar/SIMD strict oracles remain authoritative; a baseline
failure or equal failure count is not a correctness result. Fixture-honesty
and raw-bit xcorr failures remain visible and are not waived.

## Measurement follow-up

The 53-row inventory retains each measured revision and fixture. All 51
comparable routines have direct allocation measurements; startup CPU helpers
are not comparable per-call operations. ARM64 measurements require a fresh
run before attributing their timings to the current parity fixes.

On the current native AMD64 run, long CELT and SILK xcorr, tiny xcorr, SILK
float inner product, and the direct PVQ best-ID helper remain optimization
targets. Xcorr requires exact exceptional-input arithmetic before its timings
can support a complete correctness claim. The public encode/decode figures
above measure the entire path with zero steady-state allocations.
